I am really excited to look back to day 1 and understand all this stuff that is currently __mind blowing__!  :)  I am looking forward to retraining my brain back to looking at and understanding code, t has been forever!  I want to keep growing and learning and eventually create my own App one day.  Oh and *have fun* and **make new friends** along the way!
