------
What I hope to gain from this course is *versatility*. I wish to acquire knowledge that I _never_ dreamed of possessing.  
To **_create_** a program from symbols and -seemingly random- texts, **I imagine**, feels like a child lacing up their shoes   
for the first time.   
I want to feel accomplished.
